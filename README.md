# Rotten-Tomatoes-Analysis

## Introduction 
In this analysis, we explore the relationship between audience and critic scores for movies listed on Rotten Tomatoes. Rotten Tomatoes provides a unique platform where both professional critics and general audiences can rate movies, offering a dual perspective on the perceived quality of films. Understanding the correlation—or lack thereof—between these two sets of scores can reveal interesting insights into how movies are received by different groups.

> This analysis leverages data visualizations to compare and contrast the scoring patterns of audiences and critics. By examining the distribution of scores and the overall correlation between the two, we aim to answer several key questions:

- Do critics and audiences generally agree on movie ratings?
- How consistent are critics in their scoring compared to the variability seen in audience scores?
- Are there significant discrepancies between what critics value in movies versus what resonates with audiences?
